# myconfig

This is configuration file repository automated with ansible.
All my dotfiles will be eventually be moved here.
The ansible pull command then allows to apply the configuration files to any
host via a single command.

My distribution of choice is currently Manjaro KDE, which should be taken into
account for all configuration files regarding the desktop.

Moved to this repository:
 - [x] i3
 - [ ] .vimrc
 - [ ] .spacemacs
 - [ ] ranger rc.conf
 - [ ] tmux
 - [ ] zshrc
 - [ ] kitty
